# Dark Matter Halo Density Profile Calibration

In this tutorial, we calibrate dark matter density profiles using machine learning methods. Density calibration from gravitational lensing is one of the most important problems in cluster cosmology. The main objectives of this tutorial include: 
* Use neural network ensembles to better capture the complexity of density profiles and achieve more accurate density calibration. 
* Quantify prediction uncertainties (hereafter error bars). The idea is to make interval predictions rather than a single-point prediction in the case of the analytic models. This will help us capture the effect of differences in cosmology in our predictions.

A synthesis paper based on dark matter halo density profile calibration is included in this directory **Synthesis_Paper**. This is a comprehensive review of four main seed paper, namely:

 * Paper I: Dependence of the outer profiles of halos on their mass accretion rate [Diemer & Kravtsov, 2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/789/1/1).
 This paper studies the density profile of dark matter halos at large radii using data from N-body simulations. They also proposed a new analytic model for calibrating halo density profiles.
 * Paper II: The mass and galaxy distribution around SZ-selected clusters [Shin et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/507/4/5758/6366263?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=true).
 This paper measures halo density profiles from weak-lensing and galaxy number density profiles. They also considered the density profiles at large radii. They used observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the Dark Energy Survey.
 * Paper III: A dynamics-based density profile for dark halos â€“ I. Algorithm and basic results [Diemer, 2022](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/513/1/573/6561624?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=true).
This paper presents a novel algorithm to dynamically disentangle the inner and outer regions of halos and model them separately. The data used is generated from N-body simulations.
 * Paper IV: The impact of baryons on massive galaxy clusters: halo structure and cluster mass estimates [Henson et al., 2017](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/465/3/3361/2454758?login=true).
This paper measures the impact of baryons (ordinary matter) on the density profiles of massive galaxy clusters. They used data from the BAHAMAS (BAryons HAlos MAssive System) and MACSIS (MAssive ClusterS and Intercluster Structure) hydrodynamic simulations.
