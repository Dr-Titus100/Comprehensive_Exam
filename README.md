# Dark Matter Halo Density Profile Calibration

In this tutorial, we calibrate dark matter density profiles using machine learning methods. Density calibration from gravitational lensing is one of the most important problems in cluster cosmology. The main objectives of this tutorial include: 
* Use neural network ensembles to better capture the complexity of density profiles and achieve more accurate density calibration. 
* Quantify prediction uncertainties (hereafter error bars). The idea is to make interval predictions rather than a single-point prediction in the case of the analytic models. This will help us capture the effect of differences in cosmology in our predictions.

A synthesis paper based on dark matter halo density profile calibration is included in this directory **Synthesis_Paper**. This is a comprehensive review of four main seed paper, namely:

 * Paper I: Dependence of the outer profiles of halos on their mass accretion rate [Diemer & Kravtsov, 2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/789/1/1).
 * Paper II: The mass and galaxy distribution around SZ-selected clusters [Shin et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/507/4/5758/6366263?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=true).
 * Paper III: A dynamics-based density profile for dark halos â€“ I. Algorithm and basic results [Diemer, 2022](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/513/1/573/6561624?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=true).
 * Paper IV: The impact of baryons on massive galaxy clusters: halo structure and cluster mass estimates [Henson et al., 2017](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/465/3/3361/2454758?login=true).
