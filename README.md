## Overview
In this tutorial, we calibrate dark matter density profiles using machine learning methods. Density calibration from gravitational lensing is one of the most important problems in cluster cosmology. The main objectives of this tutorial include: 
* Use neural network ensembles to better capture the complexity of density profiles and achieve more accurate density calibration. 
* Quantify prediction uncertainties (hereafter error bars). The idea is to make interval predictions rather than a single-point prediction in the case of the analytic models. This will help us capture the effect of differences in cosmology in our predictions.

A synthesis paper based on dark matter halo density profile calibration is included in the directory `Synthesis_Paper`. This is a comprehensive review of four main seed papers, namely:


 * Paper I: Dependence of the outer profiles of halos on their mass accretion rate [Diemer & Kravtsov, 2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/789/1/1).
This paper studies the density profile of dark matter halos at large radii using data from N-body simulations. They also proposed a new analytic model for calibrating halo density profiles.

 * Paper II: The mass and galaxy distribution around SZ-selected clusters [Shin et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/507/4/5758/6366263?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=true).
This paper measures halo density profiles from weak-lensing and galaxy number density profiles. They also considered the density profiles at large radii. They used observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the Dark Energy Survey.

 * Paper III: A dynamics-based density profile for dark halos â€“ I. Algorithm and basic results [Diemer, 2022](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/513/1/573/6561624?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=true).
This paper presents a novel algorithm to dynamically disentangle the inner and outer regions of halos and model them separately. The data used is generated from N-body simulations.

 * Paper IV: The impact of baryons on massive galaxy clusters: halo structure and cluster mass estimates [Henson et al., 2017](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/465/3/3361/2454758?login=true).
This paper measures the impact of baryons (ordinary matter) on the density profiles of massive galaxy clusters. They used data from the BAHAMAS (BAryons HAlos MAssive System) and MACSIS (MAssive ClusterS and Intercluster Structure) hydrodynamic simulations.



## How to Use Code
Note: I assume the user of this repo is already a Python user and at least has either Anaconda or Miniconda or Miniforge installed. The person should have access to at least Jupyter Notebook or Jupyterlab. You can equally run the code using Visual studio code or Pycharm or Google colab.

To use the code in this repo follow the following steps.
* Clone the repo using the following command.

`git clone https://github.com/Dr-Titus100/Comprehensive_Exam.git`

You may also fork the repo if interested.

* Install packages. All the packages used in the notebook and their versions are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Activate your python environment and run the following command in the terminal to install all the packages at once.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note: You may create a new Python environment to run this project. This ensures your existing projects are uninterrupted. To create a new Python environment use the following command:

`conda create --name <env_name> python=<version>`


Note: The file in the directory `Multiprocessing` take a long time to run. It is advisable to run it by submitting a job on a cluster. I have also uploaded a sample bash script in that directory. I used that script to submit my job on the R2 cluster.
